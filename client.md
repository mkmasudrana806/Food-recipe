### Discussion of this project

I have developed a cooking web application. in this application i have addedd some chefs and with their recipes.

in The home page has a chefs section, recipes, client testimonials and a footer and services section by default.

In the header section have `Home `, `Chefs`, and `Recipes` as well as `Blogs`, `Log out`, `Register` and `Profile icons`.

In Log in and Register form has a toggle button and a `forgot password` system and sign in with `Google and GitHub` systems.

In the view recipes section has some features like when a user click on a recipe to see to the details. the recipe details page will show details of this recipe as well all the recipes from the same chef will be shown on the left side.
